# Regular Expression Demo
This project serves as a way for me to understand regular expressions at a deeper level.

Hope you like it :). 

## Usage
This project validates user input using JavaScript and displays real-time regex test results. It checks for:
- Numbers and non-numbers
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Non-letter characters and whitespace
- Valid names, emails, and date formats

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, modify the inputs, and see instant validation.
